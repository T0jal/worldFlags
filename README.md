# World Flags

This project was created based on the challenge of Day 23 of the 100 Days of Swift by Hacking With Swift (Paul Hudson).

The challenge was to develop an iOS App that would show flags of different countries.

The flags are clickable and show the clicked flag on a different screen.

You can check the actual challenge page on the references.
